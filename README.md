Might use this to dump some notes on various languages and tools for future
reference.

In general, for a given tool `TOOL`, its notes break out as follows:

* `TOOL_notes.md` has more general usage info.
* `TOOL_links.md` has links to useful reference material.
* `TOOL_tricks.md` has more devious/less practical info. Things I wouldn't want
  to use in serious code but might be fun otherwise.
