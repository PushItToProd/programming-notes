TDD is a methodology for shipping code faster with higher quality and less
mental overhead.


## Why I didn't get TDD (questions + assumptions)

* how are you supposed to write tests before you know what you're gonna code?
  * assumption: you have to write a lot of tests up front
  * assumption: you write all your tests up front
  * assumption: you write code in the same increments as without TDD
  * assumption: you write tests the same way as you would if you were writing
    them after your code
* what's really the point?
  * didn't really see a distinct benefit to testing first. I took people at
    their word that it was useful but I didn't actually understand
  * assumption: TDD is about writing more robust and reliable code

## Challenges with TDD

* figuring out the mechanism (e.g. how to simulate user interaction from a web
  browser and direct HTTP requests for a web app. how to simulate command line
  interaction with a shell script.)
