Generally useful things I try to do.

RTFM (Read the Full Manual)
---------------------------

Look at the functionality your tools expose. Read the docs and look for features
you didn't know were there.

Don't just turn to the docs when you need help. Read them proactively and see
what's there. Don't try to memorize every word, because that's why the manual
exists, but read it and look for things you didn't know existed. There are so
many times I've been skimming the docs for a programming language, library, or
framework and stumbled across some little feature that would have saved me _so
much work_ if I'd known about it on a past project. Or I find some feature that
I think is neat and then find a perfect opportunity to use it.

Play with your tools
--------------------

One of my favorite hobbies is trying to stretch programming languages to their
limits. I've implemented type checking and tail call optimization in Python,
I've implemented basic object-oriented programming and DSLs in Bash,


If you use it a lot, wrap it up!
--------------------------------

Use features like aliases and functions to encapsulate stuff you do a lot.


Read the source code
--------------------

The libraries you rely on have a ton of code that's worth checking out. This can
help you understand details not covered in the docs and is generally a good
skill to practice.
